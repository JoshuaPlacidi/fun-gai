### Introduction
This is a project originally built in 12 hours for a [Biology + Generative Artifical Intelligence Hackathon](https://biohacklondon.notion.site/BioHack-London-40bea186f1a24e779b276087f2ee7e61).
We use [variational auto-encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder) to learn a latent space represenation of the physiology of mushrooms, the fruiting body of fungi.


It has been estimated that more than 90% of all fungal species have yet to be described by science ![1](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64251382).
We built and trained a VAE from scratch to synthesis what new, yet undiscovered, mushrooms *could* look like.
This project was built as a fun exploration into how an auto-encoder model learns to represent images on mushrooms in 
a latent space.
